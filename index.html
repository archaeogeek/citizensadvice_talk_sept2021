					<h3>Who is this "Astun Technology" of which you speak?</h3>
					<div class="fragment">
						<p>Astun Technology was founded in 2006. We're based in Epsom, but our 25-ish staff are spread across Europe. We do spatial and data "stuff", based on an open source technology stack.</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">The sorts of services we supply are mapping platforms, spatial databases and metadata portals to clients such as Scottish Government, DEFRA, EA, Ordnance Survey and Local Authorities. We also contribute to software development, documentation and guidance, and standards implementation and development.</aside>

						<p>Hi I'm Jo ðŸ‘‹</p>
						<p>I've worked at Astun for over 10 years and lead on data discovery (metadata etc). I'm mad keen on problem solving and acting as an enabler. I also do "stuff" with OSGeo and the AGI.</p>

					<h3>Helping people create metadata</h3>
					<blockquote>"Quality metadata is key to making data discoverable"
						<footer>Geospatial Commission "Recommendations For SEO of UK Governmentâ€™s Geospatial Metadata" 2019</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Data producers need to create high-qaulity metadata, but also to employ SEO techniques to make the data more search-engine and user-friendly. Modern search engines also use the data to display richer results. Any solution must work at scale, not just for single datasets, and must be controllable by the data producer if it is to inspire confidence.
						Geospatial Commission Research from 2019 found that 70% of users searching for data will use search engines rather than portals. So, datasets are competing with lots of other results, and people need to be able to find the right dataset amongst the noise. They may not have the specialist skills to use a portal, or knowledge of the correct terms to search for.

					<p class="box-right"  style="margin-top:200px !important">Some metadata elements can be easily derived from the dataset</p>
				<aside class="notes">There are many tools out there that will derive at least some metadata elements for you, including the USGS Metadata Wizard, which has been around for many years</aside>

					<aside class="notes">This is a real example of putting a complex block of text through our prototype ML workflow. Metadata keywords should be used inside the abstract. This needs to be done intelligently, eg as part of sentences rather than lists. You should include keywords that work for all levels of expertise, and take into consideration variations in spelling, synonyms and so on. Geographic keywords help to provide context for the user.</aside>
